# mask-imp

An imperative masking/formatting component

mask-imp is intended to mask any html input element, specially thought to be used with [react controlled components](https://reactjs.org/docs/forms.html#controlled-components).

### Dependencies
It has no dependencies on jQuery or any other framework/library.

### API
It provides a simple API with two methods: masked and unmasked. The mask format itself is pretty the same as the used by [jQuery-Mask-Plugin](https://github.com/igorescobar/jQuery-Mask-Plugin).
